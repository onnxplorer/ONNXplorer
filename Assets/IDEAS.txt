grouping boxes
dedicated colors for e.g. group indicator lines, dimensional relationship
what if n-dimensional???
activations, weights, AND biases
  show two blobs, pre/post bias?

placement
  deterministic
    x is based mainly on layer
      modified by "sublayers"
      and by extra dimensions in tensors
        have vector associated with each tensor dimension (e.g., 4th dimension = [0.1, -0.1, 0.1], 5th = [0.2, 0.1, -0.1], or whatever) then each neuron's tensor index is multiplied by those vectors and added to the neuron's initial position
      could take parallel operations and give them a certain amount of YZ space, then make sure they don't overlap each other
    y and z I guess initially depend on location in tensor.  probably just that tensor_index * basis_vectors thing, really, it just works for the major YZ values in addition to smaller modifications
  nondeterministic
    connection gravity
        layer probably still determines x
        and tensor could *maybe* still modify coordinates
        but the main idea is you take each neuron, apply an attractive force on it based on the strength of its connections, and a repulsive force based on its neighbors, and iterate a bunch.
          might take a while.  could need like a KDTree to find its nearest neighbors efficiently.  I've written C# code that uses one before, but I don't remember how well it handles element positions changing.
          might be some other things to try, like simply scaling the network out to fill bounds; that MIGHT accomplish a sort of repulsive effect.
        (I've done this kind of computation before, so I can be the one to write this code.  I'm not sure I've done it on so MANY elements before, so like, I guess we'll find out how bad the processing demand is, haha.)
  could be interactive - the user scrubs the controller over neurons to make them realign or something
    also in general the user could select and move neurons

UI
  change neuron sizes
    *base* size, maybe?  to be multiplied by individual factors?
  select neurons
  select connections
  paint brush selection
  convex hull selection
